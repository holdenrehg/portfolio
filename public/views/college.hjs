<p>I am pursuing an undergraduate degree in Software Engineering at Iowa State University primarily focusing on Java and object oriented programming. I studied UI design, object oriented design and principles, data structures, algorithms, and project management. I also experimented with Swing, JDBC, and Android.</p>
<p>The job consisted of explaining object oriented fundamentals such as encapsulation, inheritence, polymorphism, and recursion using Java to students taking the course. I graded and helped create assignments, taught a weekly lab session, and proctored exams. I also answered a lot of questions.</p>
