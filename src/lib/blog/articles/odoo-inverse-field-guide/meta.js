        The concepts of an inverse field in Odoo can be a bit mysterious to a
        lot of developers. I just did a search on the Odoo docs for the phrase
        'inverse' and found 4 page results. Most of these results are about the
        One2many inverse relationship (which is not what I'm talking about in
        this article).
