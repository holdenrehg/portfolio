      The concepts of an inverse field
      in Odoo can be a bit mysterious to a lot of developers. I just did
      a search on the Odoo docs for the phrase "inverse" and found 4 page
      results. Most of these results are about the <code>One2many</code>
      inverse relationship (which is not what I'm talking about in this article).
    </p>
    <p>
      There were a few paragraphs that popped up in reference documentation
      and the best explanation that I found was the following:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      "Computed fields are readonly by default. To allow setting values on a computed field,
      use the <code>inverse</code> parameter. It is the name of a function reversing the
      computation and setting the relevant fields.
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      Now that's not too bad. We can learn the purpose of the inverse field. Generally yes, we use
      inverse fields to make computed fields writable. But I think there's a bit to expand upon when
      talking about how it actually works.
    </p>
    <h2>Starting with a computed field</h2>
    <p>
      We need to do a quick overview of what a computed field means before stepping into inverse functions, because
      inverse functions only apply to computed fields.
    </p>
    <p>
      A computed field is a field on a model that automatically computes its own value based on...
