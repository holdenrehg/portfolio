    <p>
      Businesses track horrible metrics
      for some reason. It’s of course not
      psychologically easy or intuitive to focus on the right metrics because
      they usually aren’t as exciting. You can drum up way more attention and
      make yourself feel better by focusing on numbers that, most of the time,
      don’t mean anything but are feel exciting.
    </p>
    <p>So what type of numbers am I even talking about here?</p>
    <h2>Metrics that are not really important</h2>
    <p>
      Here are some examples of metrics that are just not important for most
      businesses (businesses that are not trying to achieve rapid user growth
      to be acquired by FANG):
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Number of users, signups, or website visitors</li>
      <li>Number of employees</li>
      <li>Number of offices/facilities/locations</li>
      <li>Revenue</li>
      <li>Emails sent, calls made, or doors knocked on</li>
      <li>Rate of development</li>
      <li>Dollars or rounds of investment</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      These are some of the most common metrics that businesses like to throw
      out there. I’m sure you see...
