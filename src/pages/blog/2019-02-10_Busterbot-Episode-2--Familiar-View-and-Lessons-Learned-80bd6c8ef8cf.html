I really thought I’d have more time to document, but I guess that’s just how life works sometimes. So here are some updates, general thoughts, and lessons learned over the last few years of my life. A lot has happened.</p><h3 name="53ce" id="53ce" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">A Familiar View</h3><p name="c46d" id="c46d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">I bought into the startup bullshit.</p><p name="25ed" id="25ed" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">After trying not to, I realized that’s what I was still doing. When I started college (about 6 years ago), the “silicon valley startup” is what I knew best. All of the top tech founders were on my list of great business leader, I had a list of every local VC firm, and I read hours and hours worth of information on “funding” a startup/business.</p><p name="40e2" id="40e2" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">3 years ago I swore I had purged all of that information from my head. I realized that getting millions in funding to start a non-profitable business was not the best way to become successful.</p><p name="7ec4" id="7ec4" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">But I didn’t realize that there were still plenty of leftover ideas floating around my head. I ended up trying to focus on building something with bigger mass appeal, that had 10&#39;s of thousands of users to start, that was scalable immediately, etc. And I ended up shooting myself in the foot. I just spent my time in the wrong places doing the wrong things. The result was ending up burnt out, with a slightly Frankenstein-esque code base, that couldn’t actually make money.</p><p name="5e17" id="5e17" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I could have kept iterating on it, and maybe that would have been the right thing to do, but I lost some confidence in the idea and wasn’t having fun working on it.</p><p name="3b9f" id="3b9f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">So today my surroundings are familiar. Same kitchen table. No profitable product. Working in my spare time when I can.</p><p name="4eb5" id="4eb5" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Not too glamorous, right?</p><h3 name="3a92" id="3a92" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">Lessons Learned</h3><p name="5420" id="5420" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">Life goes on. You live. You learn.</p><p name="41bc" id="41bc" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Here’s what I’ve been learning and focusing on.</p><h4 name="0974" id="0974" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">Ignore Outside Noise</h4><p name="8e5c" id="8e5c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">It’s hard to wrap your head around the amount of content coming into your devices on a daily basis. I realized how easy it really is to become a puppet, memorizing both facts and opinions from other people and repeating them back out as your own.</p><p name="90b0" id="90b0" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">It can also be a huge waste of time scrolling through news articles and social feeds.</p><p name="d914" id="d914" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">So I’ve set up some new ground rules for myself:</p><ol class="postList"><li name="e0c8" id="e0c8" class="graf graf--li graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--li-strong">Produce your own opinions as often as possible.</strong></li></ol><p name="871c" id="871c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--li">This sounds obvious, but I found myself Googling questions that I could easily answer myself.</p><p name="464a" id="464a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">But that’s honestly not as scary as when I found myself Googling the “difficult” or more complex questions that came up day-to-day. Instead of searching for the top 10 best project management methods using Trello, I would think about it. Think about who are the people involved, what are their wants/needs, the end goal of the projects, how people would be accessing and where they are accessing from, the natural, human tendencies of people, etc. Even if I came up with bad initial ideas, it’s the process of thinking that I believe will help me long term.</p><p name="4527" id="4527" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">2. Consume facts instead of opinions</strong></p><p name="229e" id="229e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Facts and data are becoming more and more important to me every day. This gets tricky because these two concepts are usually intertwined. Reading through a book will give you plenty of facts, but with the author&#39;s perspectives mixed in.</p><p name="36fa" id="36fa" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Books are not nearly as bad as news articles, especially if reporting on politics.</p><p name="de09" id="de09" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">So I’m focusing on filtering out the opinion and keeping them separate from my opinions (even if they end up being the same). This lets me focus on absorbing the following instead of opinions:</p><ul class="postList"><li name="5e99" id="5e99" class="graf graf--li graf-after--p">Concepts</li><li name="fa5c" id="fa5c" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Theories</li><li name="1ef0" id="1ef0" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Technologies</li><li name="7213" id="7213" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Tools</li><li name="4545" id="4545" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Strategies</li><li name="5ca8" id="5ca8" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Statistics (Data)</li><li name="1397" id="1397" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Stories (History/Anecdotes)</li></ul><h4 name="635f" id="635f" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--li">Sleeping Less Is Not Healthy</h4><p name="0b00" id="0b00" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">Everyone is different.</p><p name="1c3b" id="1c3b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I personally need to sleep or there are serious short term and long term problems.</p><p name="0eb7" id="0eb7" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I can track my own productivity and it becomes clear. I took a set of tasks that I wanted to complete and rated how many hours it should roughly take me per task.</p><p name="1742" id="1742" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">When fully rested, I was very close to hitting the estimates.</p><p name="afdf" id="afdf" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">When sleeping a few hours a night and using those hours to work, I was way off. So I spent even more hours, specifically not sleeping, and still coming in way over estimates.</p><p name="abd4" id="abd4" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">It’s difficult to get it through your head that sleeping hours are not wasted hours. Not using those hours for sleep is what really wastes that time, while also corrupting waking time.</p><h4 name="e1d8" id="e1d8" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">Write More</h4><p name="8f2d" id="8f2d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">Writing thoughts down seems to transform them.</p><p name="2bf8" id="2bf8" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">It’s almost like getting a second opinion in a way. As I start typing or writing ideas down, making more detailed notes, asking myself questions, and reading things out loud, mistakes or concerns start to get filtered out.</p><p name="421a" id="421a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">It’s an amazingly simple, but important process.</p><h4 name="2b20" id="2b20" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">Ask Why</h4><p name="72f1" id="72f1" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">I’m going to ask “why” more often.</p><p name="193f" id="193f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">It’s hard to ask “why” for many different reasons. Sometimes you feel like people will think you are an idiot. Maybe that’s part of your imposter syndrome. Sometimes it’s just because I think I understand what’s going on because I’m making some assumptions.</p><p name="2d37" id="2d37" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">It’s easier to just ask “why”, get the answer. and move on.</p><h4 name="45ea" id="45ea" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">Do Not Edit Yourself</h4><p name="9f59" id="9f59" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">I will stop editing my ideas inside my head.</p><p name="d97f" id="d97f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">It’s easy to play out all the scenarios in your head, get dragged down by the negative outcomes, and scrap the idea before it gets a chance outside of your head.</p><p name="59a8" id="59a8" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Instead, I’m going to focus on getting all of my thoughts out onto paper, prioritizing which ideas I want to try out first, and then letting them run their course in real life. Maybe they don’t work out, maybe you iterate on them for a while, or maybe they are immediately successful.</p><h4 name="9ee2" id="9ee2" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">Make A Profit</h4><p name="e0ce" id="e0ce" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">It’s obviously possible to create a business without making a profit.</p><p name="8153" id="8153" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Check out Twitter and Amazon up until recently.</p><p name="4999" id="4999" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">But that’s risky.</p><p name="7fe5" id="7fe5" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">It’s easier to get a few people to start paying you for a good product, convince a few more, and then a few more, etc. until you have a stable business than it is to get hundreds of thousands of daily active users and convince investors to give you multiple rounds of millions of dollars until you can sell the business.</p><p name="54e8" id="54e8" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I plan to start making a profit as soon as I can. As soon as I have a functioning product that provides value to someone.</p><h3 name="5aa1" id="5aa1" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">What’s Next?</h3><p name="793c" id="793c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">I’m going to just keep pushing forward while trying to continue to learn and iterate on active projects. I’m hoping to talk to more people about starting businesses, business strategies, and balancing out everything in life with those businesses, so reach out if you want to chat.</p><h4 name="84c7" id="84c7" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">The New Product</h4><p name="1499" id="1499" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">Originally I was working on Busterbot which was a Slack application for businesses to stay more active in the office. This is still an active project, and still completely free.</p><p name="d9e9" id="d9e9" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">But under the same company name, I am about to release a new product called Pinwheel Suite, which is a way for businesses to easily run open source applications. Check it out at <a href="https://pinwheelsuite.com" data-href="https://pinwheelsuite.com" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">https://pinwheelsuite.com</a> and let me know what you think.</p><p name="c089" id="c089" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Thanks for reading.</p><p name="a916" id="a916" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">Holden</p></div></div></section>
