                        <p>
                            I started programming {new Date().getYear() - new Date('05/01/2011').getYear()} years ago
                            while in high school. The first website started as a pretty basic Wordpress blog, but turned
                            into a freelance business where I built websites for local businesses. It felt like the
                            best option especially compared to other job opportunities available. There was not too
                            many options for a 16 year old in my town.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Solving problems and working with business owners felt good. At least once you get to
                            the solution. So I stuck with it and <a

                                href="http://iastate.edu"

                            &nbsp;in school. Every chance I had I worked. I can't remember a week throughout school
                            where I didn't have some sort of job or work, even up to 30-40 hours a week at times. This
                            meant countless side projects, a school IT job, teching assistant for classes, remote startup
                            gigs, and summer internships.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            All of this led to working at <a

                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Over 5 five years, we would build up the team to 5 developers, a project manager, and
                            a support team member. The overall revenue of the company quadrupled, with roughly half
                            of that coming from the ERP team.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            During that time, I had a few itches to scratch. I started my own business
                            for consulting, freelancing, and writing. I also started buying rental real estate in
                            my home town.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I spent roughly 2 years freelancing. It was an interesting and useful experience.
                            I learned about working in software from a new perspective and learned about my own
                            ambitions. After looking back at the end of those 2 years, I decided to go a different direction
                            and chase a dream of working in the games industry. When I started college, I was excited
                            about the potential of working in games, but was convinced that it's not impossible. Outside of
                            applying for a handful of jobs at big studios, I didn't do much to pursue it.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            On top of that, I wanted to double down on a role in tech. Throughout my entire career, I
                            had always done more than what a typical programmer would do. I decided to move forward
                            with engineering management specifically, because that's where I felt I could have the
                            biggest impact and it was a part of my job that I enjoyed the most.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            That's where we are at today. In 2022, I started work at PlayStation. I still manage a few
                            rental properties, answer the one off email asking for my advice, and
                            <a href="/blog" class="text-yellow-600">write blog posts</a>, but most of my time is spent
                            focused on building the best products possible at PlayStation.
